# Activity and Reflections on Moderation

## Activity: Try reporting a comment

Go to a social media site and try to find spam or some other disallowed comment and report it.

YouTube comments can be a place to find these, particularly replies to comments. It's hard to know where the spammers are currently getting away with spam, but you might try the latest honest trailer from [ScreenJunkies](https://www.youtube.com/c/screenjunkies) {cite:p}`ScreenJunkiesYouTube`, sort comments by "newest first" and then look for replies and see if any are spam. If you find one, try reporting it.

* What did you think of the options you were given for reporting spam?

## Reflection Questions

- Have you ever reported a post/comment for violating social media platform rules?
- Have you ever faced consequences for breaking social media rules (or for being accused of it)?
- In unmoderated online spaces who has the most power and ability to speak and be heard? Who has the least power and ability to speak and be heard?
