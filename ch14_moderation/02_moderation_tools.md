# Moderation Tools

We've looked at what type of content is moderated, now let's look at how it is moderated. Sometimes individuals are given very little control over content moderation or defense from the platform, and then the only advice that is useful is: "don't read the comments." But some have argued that this shifts responsibility onto the individual users getting negative comments, when [the responsibility should be on the people in charge of creating the platform](https://medium.com/humane-tech/against-don-t-read-the-comments-aee43ce515b9) {cite:p}`dashDonReadComments2016`.

So let's look at the type of content moderation controls that might be given to individuals, and might be used by platforms.

## Individual User Controls

Individual users are often given a set of moderation tools they can use themselves, such as:
- __Block an account__: a user can block an account from interacting with them or seeing their content
- __Mute an account__: a user can allow an account to try interacting with them, but the user will never see what that account did.
- __Mute a phrase or topic__: some platforms let users block content by phrases or topics (e.g., they are tired of hearing about cryptocurrencies, or they don't want spoilers for the latest TV show).
- __Delete__: Some social media platforms let users delete content that was directed at them (e.g., replies to their post, posts on their wall, etc.)
- __Report__: Most social media sites allow users to report or flag content as needing moderation.

And there are other options and nuances as well, depending on the platform.

A video's comment section feels like it is owned by a creator in a way that the replies to a tweet  do not. Weird how everything kinda operates on vibe.\" Jonathan McIntosh in the quote tweet said: \"Better yet you can hold all comments for review before being made public unless a user is pre-approved.\""

## Platform Controls
Social media platforms themselves have their own options for how they can moderate comments, such as:
- __Delete__: Platforms can delete posts or comments.
- __Suspend__: Platforms can temporarily lock a user out until, for a set amount of time, or until they agree to delete some content and behave differently
- __Ban__: Platforms can permanently ban users and also try to ban users coming from certain internet connections
- __Auto-detect__: Platforms can also use computer programs to automatically detect potential violations of content to automatically block, or flag for follow-up.
