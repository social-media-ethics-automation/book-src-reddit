# Individual harassment

Individual harassment (one individual harassing another individual)  has always been part of human cultures, bur social media provides new methods of doing so.


There are many methods by which through social media.

This can be done privately through things like:
- Bullying: like sending mean messages through DMs
- Cyberstalking: Continually finding the account of someone, and creating new accounts to continue following them. Or possibly researching the person's physical location.
- Hacking: Hacking into an account or device to discover secrets, or make threats.
- Tracking: An abuser might track the social media use of their partner or child to prevent them from making outside friends. They may even install spy software on their victim's phone.
- Death threats / rape threats
- Etc.

Individual harassment can also be done publicly before an audience (such as classmates or family). For example:
- Bullying: like posting public mean messages
- Impersonation: Making an account that appears to be from someone and having that account say things to embarrass or endanger the victim.
