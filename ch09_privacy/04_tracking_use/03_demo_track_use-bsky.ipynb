    "## How can we trust code libraries?\n",
    "If people can make code libraries track us and violate our privacy, how can we trust them? We could try looking at the [source code for the PRAW library](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/) to try and make sure the library we are using isn't doing anything bad, but no programmer can be expected to read through all the libraries they use. There is unfortunately no simple answer to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, there are cases where people have messed with code libraries:\n",
    "- The United States National Security Agency \"[paid massive computer security firm RSA $10 million to promote a flawed encryption system so that the surveillance organization could wiggle its way around security.](https://gizmodo.com/nsa-paid-security-firm-10-million-bribe-to-keep-encryp-1487442397)\"\n",
    "  - Does US national security outweigh global computer security? \n",
    "- Shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, someone modified a popular NodeJS code library so that it would [automatically destroy files if it was run on a computer in Russia or Belarus](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/03/sabotage-code-added-to-popular-npm-package-wiped-files-in-russia-and-belarus/).\n",
    "  - Does opposing a military invasion justify sabatoging a code library? \n",
    "  \n",
    "And those are just the intentional problems with code libraries. All sorts of code libraries and computer programs are full of security flaws, which are regularly discovered and fixed (though who knows how much the flaws were exploited first).\n"
