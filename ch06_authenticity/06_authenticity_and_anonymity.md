# Authenticity and Anonymity

We mentioned in the last chapter the cases of 4chan and 8chan, where anonymous users trolled each other and posted offensive content, and one question that might lead us to is:
> Does anonymity discourage authenticity and encourage inauthentic behavior?

The answer to this question might be yes in some circumstances, but also, the opposite might occur in others.

## Anonymity encouraging inauthentic behavior
Anonymity can encourage _inauthentic_ behavior because, with no way of tracing anything back to you[^tracing_back], you can get away with pretending you are someone you are not, or behaving in ways that would get your true self in trouble.


## Anonymity encouraging authentic behavior
Anonymity can also encourage _authentic_ behavior. If there are aspects of yourself that you don't feel free to share in your normal life (thus making your normal life _inauthentic_), then anonymity might help you share them without facing negative consequences from people you know.

## Is authentic self-expression good?
We can next ask if authentic self-expression is a good thing or not. But that depends, what is the authentic thing about yourself that you would be expressing?
- Are you authentically expressing hate or cruelty? If so, perhaps authentic self-expression is morally bad.
- Are you part of an oppressed or marginalized group that has been restricted from self-expression? Then perhaps expressing yourself is morally good.

```{list-table} Some example ethical and unethical scenarios for combinations of anonymity and authenticity.
:header-rows: 1
:name: example-table

* - 
  - Real Identity
  - Anonymous or Fake Identity
* - Authentic
  - __Ethically good scenario:__
    Someone can express good true things about themselves freely under their real identity, since their community accepts them.

    ---
    
    __Ethically bad scenario:__
    Someone who has bad views (e.g., racism, misogyny), feels social freedom to express those views under their real identity, since their community accepts those views.
  - __Ethically good scenario:__
    Someone who normally has to hide good true things about themselves, can express it when they are anonymous.

    ---
    
    __Ethically bad scenario:__
    Someone who has bad views (e.g., racism, misogyny) which they feel social pressure to hide, feels free to express those views when they are anonymous.
* - Inauthentic
  - __Ethically good scenario:__
    Someone who has bad views (e.g., racism, misogyny), feels social pressure to hide those views because people will know who they are.

    ---
    
    __Ethically bad scenario:__
    Someone feels they have to hide good true thing about themselves because people will know who they are.
  - __Ethically good scenario:__
    When someone calls an emergency number, like 911, the worker answering the call is anonymous and suppresses their own emotional reaction (“emotional labor”), so they can help the person who has an emergency.

    ---
    
    __Ethically bad scenario:__
    Someone who impersonates an identity they don’t have to attack a group (e.g., sock-puppets, concern trolling, etc.), or someone who anonymously harasses others.

% Alt example for ethically good inauthentic anonymous: Someone who defends vulnerable people by infiltrating and/or sabotaging a hate group or harmful system. See later sections on trolling examples, data poisoning, justifying harassment.


% TODO: Add Vonnegut quote: "We are who we pretend to be" or maybe to trolling

[^tracing_back]: In reality, while many times people can remain anonymous, surprisingly often, anonymous users' identities can be discovered and revealed, whether through hacks or accidentally revealed information.
