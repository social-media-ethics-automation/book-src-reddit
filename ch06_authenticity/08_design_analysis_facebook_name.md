# Design Analysis: Facebook Names Rules
We want to provide you, the reader, a chance to explore authenticity more, particularly considering how the rules built into social media platforms influence authenticity.

In this activity, you will be looking at Facebook's name policy, and thinking through who this version of authenticity works for, and who it doesn't[^alternate_exercise].


[^alternate_exercise]: You could also try this with different social media authenticity systems, like [How to Get Verified on Bumble](
https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/the-end-of-catfishing-introducing-photo-verification) {cite:p}`BumbleHowGeta`, which has the user take photos while mimicking poses.

alt: "A screenshot of Facebook's name policy, which in this screenshot reads as follows:
Names allowed on Facebook.

Facebook is a community where everyone uses the name they go by in everyday life. This makes it so that you always know who you're connecting with.

What isn't allowed?
• Symbols, numbers, unusual capitalization, repeating characters or punctuation.
• Characters from multiple languages.
• Titles of any kind (example: professional, religious).
• Words or phrases in place of a name.
• Offensive or suggestive words of any kind.
If your name follows our standards and you're still having trouble changing it, find out why.

Things to keep in mind
• The name on your profile should be the name that your friends call you in everyday life. This name should also appear on an ID or • document from our ID list.
• Nicknames can be used as a first or middle name if they're a variation of your authentic name (like Bob instead of Robert).
• You can also list another name on your account (example: maiden name, nickname, professional name).
• Profiles are for individual use only. You can create a Page for a business, organization or idea.
• Pretending to be anything or anyone isn't allowed."

This activity follows [the five-step CIDER method](https://medium.com/@OAlannah/beyond-average-users-building-inclusive-design-skills-with-the-cider-technique-413969544e6d?source=friends_link&sk=6c9184c8a88feae058cfb073a44985f7) {cite:p}`olesonAverageUsersBuilding2022` (Critique, Imagine, Design, Expand, Repeat), created by [Alannah Oleson, et. al.](https://alannaholeson.com/) {cite:p}`AlannahOlesonPhD`. This activity works best if you can do it with others (like in a classroom), so you can learn from their observations as well.

![Diagram of the CIDER method. 5 steps in order from left to right: Critique (Identify embedded assumptions about users); Imagine (Pick one assumption and envision how it excludes users); Design (Brainstorm changes to improve inclusion); Expand (Learn about new types of bias from peers' assumptions); Repeat (Redo I and D using new-to-you assumptions from EXPAND list).](cider-method.jpeg)

So read through the Facebook name policy above (for this activity ignore clarifications or exceptions Facebook may have made elsewhere, since those weren't deemed important enough to put on this main policy page). Then do the following (preferably on paper or in a blank computer document):

## Critique (3-5 minutes, by yourself):
What assumptions does Facebook's name policy make about its users' identities and their needs that might not be true or might cause problems? List as many as you can think of (bullet points encouraged).


````{admonition} If you are having trouble getting started, click to see some sample assumptions
:class: dropdown
Facebook assumes that accounts will be controlled by individuals (instead of e.g., families)

Facebook assumes a real name is safe to use (not necessarily true for some LGBTQIA people whose families might kick them out or political dissidents)
````

## Imagine (2-3 minutes, by yourself):
Select one of the above assumptions that you think is important to address. Then write a 1-2 sentence scenario where a user could not use Facebook as expected because of the assumption you selected. This represents one way the design could exclude certain users.

## Design (3-5 minutes, by yourself):
Brainstorm ways to change Facebook's name policy to avoid the scenario you wrote above. List as many different kinds of potential solutions you can think of – aim for ten or more (bullet points encouraged).

## Expand (5-10 minutes, with others):
Combine your list of critiques with someone else's (or if possible, have a whole class combine theirs).

You can also consider looking at the [Wikipedia page on the Facebook real-name policy controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_real-name_policy_controversy) {cite:p}`FacebookRealnamePolicy2023`

## Repeat the Imagine and Design Tasks:
Select another assumption from the list above that you think is important to address. Make sure to choose a different assumption than you used before. Choose one that you didn’t come up with yourself, if possible. Repeat the Imagine and Design steps.
