# Game: Try being a content moderator

Try playing the game: __Moderator Mayhem__{cite:p}`noauthor_moderator_nodate`, where you play the role of a content moderator who has to make quick decisions on how to handle different posts:

You can play it more than once, and you can play it with others so you can discuss your decisions as you make them.

## Reflection questions:
* What did it feel like to make content moderation decisions?
* How did time pressure change your experience?
* What decisions felt the hardest? What felt the easiest?
* How does this change your perspective (if at all) on the job of a content moderator?
* Do you think this game was realistic?
