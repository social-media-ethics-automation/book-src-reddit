# Design Activity
Come up with at least two different theoretical sets of rules (recommendation algorithms) for what would make a “good” social media post to recommend.
  - Consider all the information you could get about a post, both from the social media API, and also information the social media company has internally. For example:
    - post engagement
    - Information about the user
    - Information about the topic (that we can try to guess)
    - Other data mining strategies (like Sentiment Analysis)
  - Compare your two different strategies, and think about how users might try to behave in order to game the algorithm
