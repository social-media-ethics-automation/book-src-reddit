# Reflections on the Bot

- When one of us ran the program, who made those posts (me? you? the bot?)?
- Notice that there are at least three times of actions for posting on social media with a bot, one is when the code was originally written, another is when the code was modified, and and the other is when the code is run. These could even be done by different people.
  - How do you divide out responsibility for a bots actions between the person writing the code and the person running the program?
