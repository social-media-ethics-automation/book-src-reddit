# Social Media Platform Examples

There are a wide variety of social media platforms with different aims and ways of engaging with them.

We can't give every example, but here is a range of different things social media platforms do (though this is all an oversimplification).

Some platforms are used for sharing text and pictures (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, WeChat, Weibo, QQ), some for sharing video (e.g., Youtube, TickTock), some for sharing audio (e.g., Clubhouse), some for sharing fanfiction (e.g., Fanfiction.net, AO3), some for gathering and sharing knowledge (e.g., Wikipedia, Quora, StackOverflow), some for sharing erotic content (e.g, OnlyFans).

Some platforms are primarily intended for forming connections and building networks, like Facebook for friends and family, and LinkedIn for business connections.

There are also platforms built around activities like gaming (Discord), and dating and hookups (e.g. Bumble, Tinder, OKCupid, etc.).

Platforms can be minimalist, like [Yo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_(app)) {cite:p}`YoApp2023`, which only lets you say "yo" to people and nothing else.

Platforms can also be tailored for specific groups of people, like a [social media platforms for low-income blind people in India](https://www.adityavashistha.com/uploads/2/0/8/0/20800650/vism_assets_2015.pdf) {cite:p}`vashisthaSocialMediaPlatforms2015`.

Additionally, some sites are primarily built for other purposes but have a social media component as well, such as the Amazon online store that has user reviews and customer questions & answers, or news sites that have comment sections.

There are many other varieties of social media sites, though hopefully we have at least covered a decent range of them.
