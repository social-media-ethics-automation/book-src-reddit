# Social Media and “Real Life”

When we (the authors) were young, as internet-based social media was starting to become commonly used, a popular sentiment we often heard was:
> “The internet isn’t real life.”

This was used as a way to devalue time spent on social media sites, and to dismiss harms that occurred on them. 

Versions of this phrase are still around, such as in this tweet from statistician Nate Silver:
> [![Nate Silver tweets: "Twitter is not real life part 69420", quote tweeting Harry Enten saying "Most of the polling indicated NYC'ers wanted Amazon in NYC. When tax breaks were mentioned, support did fall. But even with it mentioned, support was very strong in Queens." Tweet was post at 8:55 AM on February 14th, 2019.](twitter_not_real_life.png)](https://twitter.com/natesilver538/status/1096090507762167810) {cite:p}`natesilver[@natesilver538]TwitterNotReal2019a`

In that tweet, Nate Silver seems to be saying that conversations and views represented on Twitter are not representative of most people, thus devaluing the conversations and views expressed on Twitter.

We also see this phrase used to say that things seen on social media are not authentic, but are manipulated, such as people only posting their good news and not bad news, or people using photo manipulation software to change how they look.

We're curious to see how this phrase is continued to be used, and how these sentiments are continuing, being rejected, or evolving.

## Reflection questions
