# As a Member of Society

As a member of society, we hope you are informed about the role social media plays in shaping society, such as how design decisions and bots can influence social movements (polarizing, spreading, or stifling different them), and the different economic, social, and governmental pressures that social media platforms operate under.

We hope you are then able to advocate for ways of improving how social media operates in society. That might be through voting, pressuring government officials, spreading ideas and information, or organizing coordinated actions or protests.
