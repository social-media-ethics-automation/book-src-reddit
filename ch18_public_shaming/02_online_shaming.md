# Online Criticism and Shaming

While public criticism and shaming have always been a part of human culture, the Internet and social media have created new ways of doing so.

We've seen examples of this before with Justine Sacco and with crowd harassment (particularly dogpiling).


For an example of public shaming, we can look at late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel's annual Halloween prank, where he has parents film their children as they tell the parents tell the children that the parents ate all the kids' Halloween candy. Parents post these videos online, where viewers are intended to laugh at the distress, despair, and sense of betrayal the children express. I will not link to these videos which I find horrible, but instead link you to these articles:

We can also consider events in the #MeToo movement as at least in part public shaming of sexual harassers (but also of course solidarity and organizing of victims of sexual harassment, and pushes for larger political, organizational, and social changes).

## Aside on “Cancel Culture”
The term "cancel culture" can be used for public shaming and criticism, but is used in a variety of ways, and it doesn't refer to just one thing.

The offense that someone is being canceled for can range from sexual assault of minors (e.g., R. Kelly, Woody Allen, Kevin Spacey), to minor offenses or even misinterpretations.

The consequences for being "canceled" can range from simply the experience of being criticized, to loss of job or criminal charges.

Given the huge range of things "cancel culture" can be referring to, we'll mostly stick to talking here about "public shaming," and "public criticism."
