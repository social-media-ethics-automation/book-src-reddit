## Land Acknowledgement
We want to respectfully acknowledge that the land on which we did the majority of this work is the traditional home of the [Coast Salish people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_Salish), the traditional home of all tribes and bands within the [Duwamish](https://www.duwamishtribe.org/), [Suquamish](https://suquamish.nsn.us/), [Tulalip](https://www.tulaliptribes-nsn.gov/) and [Muckleshoot](https://www.wearemuckleshoot.org/) nations. This land was taken from these tribes mainly by means of conquest and the rule of force rather than through legal process or transfer of ownership based on free will of all involved. We cannot undo the past; however, we feel obliged to acknowledge wrongdoing and work to ensure the sovereignty of tribes today.
