I KNOW RIGHT

now imagine, with that being a main meat chicken breed before the modern hybrids, how much of a fucking dolt anybody who says "we've bred meat birds to be unnaturally big now" must be

modern hybrids got problems but "unnaturally large for a chicken" ain't it

"Breeders forced modern birds to grow bigger-"

better not say that where the old breeds can hear you

Average slaughter weight of a broiler today: 6-7lbs

Average slaughter weight of a Brahma (old breed meat chicken): 8-12lbs

The problem here isn't sheer size! Today's broiler chickens are a pretty moderate weight for an adult chicken!

The problem is they reach that adult weight super fucking fast. They got adult muscles on a toddler skeleton.

Is the difference kind of pedantic: You know what, no.

It's a great way to filter out opinionators who don't know what they're on about.

As I pointed out in the replies above, the OP got a LOT of things wrong about the poultry industry.

"We started giving poultry hormones." Not true- hormones are used on cattle, not poultry.

"Agbiz took over the poultry industry." Not true- farm men partnered with agribusiness to take poultry businesses over *from their own wives.*

Taken together, this isn't a couple details being wrong.

It's a whole false narrative: agribusiness forcing  excessive growth onto innocent family farms.

The details are wrong because *the whole narrative is wrong.*

And the details were made up to fit the false narrative.

What really happened in the poultry industry?

Not agribusiness takeover!

What really happened: poultry used to be women's work. Then around 1900, women started making enough money that men noticed.
@sarahtaber@mastodon.online
@SarahTaber_bww
It's a pattern. The late medieval brewing industry; poultry, dairy, & to some extent produce in the early 1900s; & today with flower farming. Men force women into the worst-paying parts of the food system. But once those trades start making $, the women have to go.

But, raising poultry is detail-oriented. Since poultry was women's work, men didn't have the technical wherewithal to handle the husbandry, veterinary, & most importantly, the marketing.

So farm women were able to keep control over their poultry businesses through WW2.

US farm country 1900-1940s had an enormous battle of the sexes over who would control the poultry trade. It was all over the farm journals at the time.

An extension agent who worked with farm families in Minnesota, before farm men fully realized the income potential in poultry, put it this way.

(Cora Cooke, quoted in "Farmers Helping Farmers" by Nancy K. Berlage.)

“The poultry flock was almost universally the project of the farm woman. … [S]he wanted her flock to contribute to the family income; she had confidence in its ability to do so. With few exceptions, the farmer himself took the opposite view, offering resistance.”

Farm men didn't want to invest any of "their" money into their wives' poultry businesses.

And women for the most part couldn't have their own bank accounts.

So women's poultry businesses stagnated, growing slowly on a cash-only basis.

That's why poultry was a "rare treat" before World War 2!

Not because of smaller heirloom breeds or w/e.

It's because poultry was women's work, thus nobody was investing in growing poultry. That's why poultry stayed a niche meat for so long.

Because of sexism. LOL

So that's the backdrop: how the poultry trade worked in the US before WW2.

After the war? Guys wanted in.

But they had no experience. No idea how to keep birds healthy, or how to slaughter & market them.

So men needed a crutch.

THAT is how agribusiness got involved.

Businesses popped up offering to "help" farm men by selling them a ready-made poultry business- the same way farm men were already used to buying tractors & other equipment.

Pre-made barns, veterinary care, & don't worry we'll slaughter & sell the birds for you!

This was super appealing to men.

-They had no experience w hands on husbandry with poultry. And little or no experience selling farm goods at all.

-But they DID have control of their family's bank accounts!

Unlike their wives, they could sign for loans to grow their business🙃

That's how "agribusiness takeover" happened in poultry.

Farm men REFUSED to invest in poultry when it was their wives doing it.

Then they put their whole families in hock to do it badly themselves.

The shitty "agribusiness" practices we're all decrying in poultry now-

crowded barns, birds that grow too fast, lots of medication, massive slaughterhouses full of poorly paid immigrants-

all come straight out of farm men buying businesses they didn't know how to run.

That's why agbiz managed to set the terms on which meat chickens would be raised. Because they were selling business kits to people who didn't know what they were doing. Or even see a need to learn.

The mentality seemed to be "my mom/wife raises chickens, how hard can it be?"

That's how family farms "lost" control of the poultry industry to agribusiness.

They didn't lose it at all! Farm men GAVE IT UP.

Why? Same reason a lot of guys still get nervous when their wife makes more money than they do.

Farm men made a conscious choice to ally with agribusiness against their own families.

They decided they'd rather be a big man in the poorhouse, than be financially comfortable and owe that comfort to their wives.

That's "agribusiness takeover" narrative whitewashes all that out.

It frames family farms as helpless victims who need to be saved from the agribusiness monster. Like the starlet in a B movie.

But in reality, farm men did this to their own families.

This probably sounds wild to people who don't work in agriculture. But comes as a surprise to absolutely nobody who's actually worked in the biz lmao

Again, this whole story plays out extremely clearly in farm publications from about 1900-1960. You can find details in Nancy Berlage's "Farmers Helping Farmers."

*In terms of how family farms do division of labor in-house. When it comes to farm labor outside the nuclear family, race matters a lot more than gender.
