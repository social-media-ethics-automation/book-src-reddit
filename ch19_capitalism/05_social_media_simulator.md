# Game: Try running a social media company

Try playing the game: __Trust & Safety Tycoon__{cite:p}`masnick_trust_nodate`, where you have to balance capitalist demands with trust and safety concerns with a social media website you are creating:

You can play it more than once, and you can play it with others so you can discuss your decisions as you make them.

## Reflection questions:
* What was the end result of your decisions? How do you feel about that?
* What decisions felt the hardest? What felt the easiest?
* Do you think this game was realistic?
