# Planned Crowdsourcing Examples
Let's now consider some examples of planned crowdsourcing, meaning a system or task was intentionally created and given to a crowd to work on.

## Crowdsourcing Platforms
Some online platforms are specifically created for crowdsourcing. For example:
- [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) {cite:p}`Wikipediaa`: Is an online encyclopedia whose content is crowdsourced. Anyone can contribute, just go to an unlocked Wikipedia page and press the edit button. Institutions don't get special permissions (e.g., [it was a scandal when US congressional staff edited Wikipedia pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_congressional_staff_edits_to_Wikipedia) {cite:p}`UnitedStatesCongressional2023`), and the expectation that editors do not have outside institutional support is intended to encourage more people to contribute.
- [Quora](https://www.quora.com/) {cite:p}`Quora`: An crowdsourced question and answer site.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) {cite:p}`StackOverflowWhere`:  A crowdsourced question-and-answer site specifically for programming questions.
- [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/) {cite:p}`AmazonMechanicalTurk`: A site where you can pay for crowdsourcing small tasks (e.g., pay a small amount for each task, and then let a crowd of people choose to do the tasks and get paid).
- [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/) {cite:p}`UpworkWorldWork`: A site that lets people find and contract work with freelancers (generally larger and more specialized tasks than Amazon Mechanical Turk.
- [Project Sidewalk](https://projectsidewalk.org) {cite:p}`ProjectSidewalk`: Crowdsourcing sidewalk information for mobility needs (e.g., wheelchair users).

## Example Crowdsourcing Tasks

You probably already have some ideas of how crowds can work together on things like editing articles on a site like Wikipedia or answer questions on a site like Quora, but let's look at some other examples of how crowds can work together.

[Fold-It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foldit) {cite:p}`Foldit2023` is a game that lets players attempt to fold proteins. At the time, researchers were having trouble getting computers to do this task for complex proteins, so they made a game for humans to try it. Researchers analyzed the best players' results for their research and were able to publish scientific discoveries based on the contributions of players.

A [research study](https://uist.acm.org/archive/adjunct/2009/pdf/doctoral_symposium/paper193.pdf) {cite:p}`littleTurKitToolsIterative` demonstrated the power of crowd work by having Mechanical Turk workers build off of the work done by previous workers. To demonstrate, they wrote a note with intentionally bad and almost undecipherable handwriting:
```{figure} bad_handwriting.png

```

Turkers (the people who do Mechanical Turk tasks) were then given the handwritten note and after the first few attempts at deciphering it, Turkers were either a previous attempt at deciphering the note, or asked to vote on which interpretations were improvements. They were instructed to leave parentheses around sections they weren't sure about. Here is a selection of subsequent attempts at interpreting the note ([from the paper](https://uist.acm.org/archive/adjunct/2009/pdf/doctoral_symposium/paper193.pdf) {cite:p}`littleTurKitToolsIterative`):
