# Visualizing Networks

Visualizing crowds and social media networks can be done with Python. Unfortunately, I don't have time to put this together at the moment (maybe by the time class starts).

So for now, I'll point you to the [Network Analysis](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/06-Network-Analysis/00-Network-Analysis.html) {cite:p}`NetworkAnalysisIntroduction` section of Melanie Walsh's [Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics) {cite:p}`walshMelaniewalshIntroCulturalAnalyticsVersion2021` online textbook.

% TODO: Make this about how for most people, your friends are more popular than you
% Do fake example first, then connect to actual social media
