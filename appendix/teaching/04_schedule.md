# Course Schedule

## Homework placements
The [](03_course_work/03_assignments/00_intro.md) are dependent on prior chapter material as follows:

- [](03_course_work/03_assignments/a1_make_7_posts.ipynb) depends on Chapter 3 [](../../ch03_bots/00_bots.md)
- [](03_course_work/03_assignments/a2_another_site.md) is basically a repeat of A1
- [](03_course_work/03_assignments/a3_troll_reply_bot.ipynb) depends on Chapter 7 [](../../ch07_trolling/00_trolling.md)
- [](03_course_work/03_assignments/a4-political-bias.ipynb) depends on Ch 8 [](../../ch08_data_mining/00_data_mining.md)
- [](03_course_work/03_assignments/a5-best-comments.ipynb) depends on Ch 14 [](../../ch14_moderation/00_moderation.md)

_Note: We haven't yet placed the project or writing assignments on the schedules below. You will have to look at those and back track how many weeks early you want students to start those_


## Combining Chapters

Depending on your specific schedule, you may need to double up some chapters in lectures. Some good candidate topics for doubling up are:

- Ch 1 Intro / Ch 2 Definitions
- Ch 6 Authenticity / Ch 7 Trolling
- Ch 14 Content Moderation / Ch 15 Content Moderators
- Ch 19 Capitalism / Ch 20 Colonialism

## Necessary and Skippable Programming Demos

Some of the programming demos are necessary for understanding future content programming demos and assignments, and some are not. Here is the current status of this:

- Ch 1: _No demo_
- Ch 2: **Necessary** (define programming, comments)
- Ch 3: **Necessary** (program organization, specifically statements, variables, and sleep)
- Ch 4: **Necessary** (data types)
- Ch 5: **Necessary** (loops, lists, dictionaries)
- Ch 6: Skippable (get author info)
- Ch 7: **Necessary** (conditionals, string manipulation)
- Ch 8: **Necessary** (sentiment analysis, loop variables)
- Ch 9: **Necessary** (writing functions)
- Ch 10: Skippable (alt-text)
- Ch 11: **Necessary** (dictionary counters)
- Ch 12: _No demo (yet)_
- Ch 13: Skippable (only positive news)
- Ch 14: **Necessary** (Display comment/reply tree recursively)
- Ch 15: _No demo_
- Ch 16: _No demo (yet)_
- Ch 17: _No demo (yet)_
- Ch 18: _No demo (yet)_
- Ch 19: _No demo_
- Ch 20: _No demo_
- Ch 21: _No demo_
