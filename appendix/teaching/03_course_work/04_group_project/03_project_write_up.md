# Project Write-Up

This is the place to turn in your code and your write-up for your project.

Make sure to turn in a Jupyter Notebook (or pdf) file that has the following:

- A description of what your project is supposed to do
- The code of your project
- Three ethics questions you are considering, with your thoughts on the ethical concerns, and how they might be addressed (each question has to be answered using two ethics frameworks, for a total of at least 4 sentences for each question)
