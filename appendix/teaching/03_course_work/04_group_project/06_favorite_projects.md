# Your Favorite Projects
In order to encourage seeing the projects, we want you to look at the projects in the shared project fair document and choose your three of your favorites (not your own) and say something about why you liked them.

What you need to do is list 3 project groups and write one sentence for each telling us why you like that project.

We'll announce which projects were the class favorite projects after we've tallied everyone's favorite projects.
