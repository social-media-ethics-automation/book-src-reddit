# Peer Evaluation

This assignment is a mechanism for ensuring that all members of each final project group contribute fairly to the project.  Based on the feedback from one's peers, an individuals' final project grade may be increased or decreased up to 10 points.

Note: We recognize that not everyone has the same prior programming experience, so we will take that into account and want you to take that into account when considering what is a fair contribution from each member.

Each person will fill out this form describing the contributions of each group member. Simply filling out the form below will give you 10 points (out of 10). Not filling it out starts you at 0 out of 10. If it is clear that a group member contributed an extraordinary amount more than all other group members, that individual may earn up to 10 more points (up to 20 out of 10). On the other hand, if the evaluations indicate that an individual contributed significantly less on the project, they may lose up to 10 points for 0/10 if they filled out their form or -10 / 10 if they didn't. If it is clear that a student did not participate at all in this part of the project, we may give them a negative score on this assignment to cancel out their project score.

 

ALSO: Tell us if you are okay with us sharing your project with future classes
