# Project Presentation
Please do the following:


Export the Jupyter Notebook of your project (with the description, code, ethics questions and reflections) as a pdf, and then upload it to google drive so you can share it with the rest of the class.


Fill out the following questions in a shared Project Fair google doc:

- Your group members
- A short description of what your program is supposed to do (~ 2 sentences):
- Link to a pdf of your project on Google Drive (make sure it is shared): 
- List your three ethics questions:
- Say what you found most challenging in doing your project (~ 2 sentences):


## Note to instructor:
If you are using a shared Google Doc or something, what can work well is to give each team a page in the doc. At the top of each page put the group number as a title (with space for students to put their project name), then leave some space for the group to answer the questions and use a new-page break to go to the next page.
