# Project Proposal

## Draft Project Proposal
In the class period before the proposal is due, create a draft copy of your project proposal (see below) and bring it with you to section this week so that the TAs can give feedback on your draft. This feedback may be on ideas or ethics, or may be on the feasibility of creating your proposed bot.

The points here are just participation points for having something ready for your TA to look at.

## Project Proposal

Your group must make a proposal for your project. It doesn't have to be long, and certainly should be less than 3 pages. Your proposal must state:

- What program you want to make. Include both:
  - The simplest version that would do something interesting ([Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product))
  - Your dream version with all the features you would want
- How you intend to make it (like, using for loops, or searching for your mentions, etc.)
- What your proposed three ethical questions are
- What your proposed two ethics frameworks are
