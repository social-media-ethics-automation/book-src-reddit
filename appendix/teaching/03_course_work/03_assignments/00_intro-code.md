# Programming Assignments

All assignment files are in the github repository here:
[https://github.com/social-media-ethics-automation/book/tree/main/docs/reddit/_sources/appendix/teaching/01_course_work/03_assignments](https://github.com/social-media-ethics-automation/book/tree/main/docs/reddit/_sources/appendix/teaching/01_course_work/03_assignments)

You may also want the fake_api files here: [https://github.com/social-media-ethics-automation/book/tree/main/docs/reddit/_sources/fake_apis/](https://github.com/social-media-ethics-automation/book/tree/main/docs/reddit/_sources/fake_apis/)


Additionally, we assume you (or your students) will have a separate key files (e.g., `reddit_keys.py`, `discord_keys.py`, etc.).
