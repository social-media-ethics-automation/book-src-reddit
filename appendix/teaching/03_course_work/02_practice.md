# Programming practice

Throughout the book, many programming demos are followed by programming practice problems. There are solutions for these practice problems in the appendix ([](../../solutions/00_solutions.md)). You can make these exercises graded for effort/completeness, or graded for correctness (though the solutions are easy to find in the book itself).

We recommend providing in-class time where students can work on these and ask for help from instructors or TAs if they get stuck or have questions.
