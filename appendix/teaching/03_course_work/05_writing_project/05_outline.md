# Outline of Using Frameworks

Now that you have your scenario or topic as well as two ethics frameworks, it's time to look at the scenario/topic through the two ethics frameworks. You'll use each framework to look at the topic/scenario and see how you would decide what is ethical or not and what tradeoffs you might be considered.

What you need to do here is make three outlines (doesn't yet have to be social media content):

1. Analyze the topic/scenario from the perspective of the first ethics framework
2. Analyze the topic/scenario from the perspective of the second ethics framework
3. Compare and contrast how the two ethics frameworks worked with the topic/scenario. Did the different frameworks highlight different aspects of the issue/scenario?

These outlines should be fairly detailed and give us a sense of what the actual written paper sections will look like.
