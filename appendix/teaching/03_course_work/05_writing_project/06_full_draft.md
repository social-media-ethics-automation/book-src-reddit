#  Writing Project Draft
By now you should have the pieces in place for you to make a full rough draft of your writing project.

An example proposed outline of your project would be:

- Introduction / hook
  - Draw your readers attention to the topic at hand. Starting by telling about a story or event can be one way of doing this
- Description of the topic / scenario
  - Use the sources you found in Sourcing the topic/scenario to explain the topic/scenario so that your readers understand what's going on before you start analyzing it with ethics frameworks
- Ethics Framework 1 analysis
  - Explain the ethics framework (which you did for Ethics framework background)
  - Analyze the topic/scenario through that framework (which you outlined in Outline of using frameworks)
- Ethics Framework 2 analysis
  - Explain the ethics framework (which you did for Ethics framework background)
  - Analyze the topic/scenario through that framework (which you outlined in Outline of using frameworks)
- Compare/Contrast how the two ethics frameworks applied to the issue/scenario
  - (you also outlined this in Outline of using frameworks)
- Conclude with what your primary ethical concerns are with the issue/scenario 
  - Your conclusions should be based the work that you did using the two ethics frameworks
  - You could say that in your view one framework fits the situation well and another doesnâ€™t, or that looking at both together provides more insight than either one by itself. You can also conclude that both frameworks missed something that you think was important.

You are free to organize your project differently than my suggested outline, as long as your paper covers all those key points.

Your rough draft should be basically complete from beginning to end (e.g., no bullet point outlines or unfinished sections), and all sources should be cited properly within the social media format you are using (e.g., citations like MLA, hyperlinks, notes in the video description, holding up a book on screen, screenshots, etc.). It's ok if some sections don't make fully make sense or some transitions or sentences are awkward, or you have a lot of typos.
