# Sourcing Topic/Scenario


## Finding Sources
Now that you have a proposal, you need to find sources on the topic/scenario that you will be analyzing. Even if you are talking about an event that happened to you, you will need to find additional sources to put what happened in a larger context.

You will need to list at least 4 sources and make an annotated bibliography.

- You will need to have at least two sources that are journalistic or academic
  - Meaning they go through a journalistic or academics standards process, not wikipedia, or the class textbook, or a random person posting a blog or a social media post
  - For example: a book, or a journalistic source like npr, the Washington Post, wired.com, Vice Magazine's Motherboard section, polygon.com, etc.

For each source do the following:

- Write a citation for the source
  - You can use any standard citation format such as APA or MLA
  - You can google something like "citation generator" to find websites that will help you format your citation
- Write a paragraph of why you are using this source and what you are planning on using from it

## Citation Style
For your chosen format of presentation (post, video, podcast, etc.), find an example of someone else citing their source in that format that you want to emulate for citing your own sources in your final project. Turn in a screenshot or link (with timecode if relevant) to show how citation was done, and describe how you plan on citing in your final format.
