# Ethics Frameworks Background

Now it's time to made summaries of your two ethics frameworks. These summaries should be more in depth than the book's short oversimplified summaries.

For each ethics framework summary make social media content about the ethics framework:

- The summary should be at the equivalent of at least a couple paragraphs
- The summary must include at least one source that is more academic or historical (not Wikipedia or the book). For example:
  - You could quote Confucius for Confucianism
  - You can quote from articles from the Stanford Encyclopedia of PhilosophyLinks to an external site.
  - If you are doing American Indigenous Ethics, I'd suggest doing a google search for a pdf of V.F. Cordova: Ethics: The We and the I (from the book American Indian Thought: Philosophical Essays).
- When you are making your summary, keep in mind how you plan to use it with your scenario. Make sure your summary includes aspects of the ethics frameworks that you think you will want to use later.
