# Final Project

This is your chance to clean up your rough draft and improve your writing project.

You should have received feedback on your full draft of the writing project, so take the feedback you received as well as your own thoughts looking back over the project and improve it and clean it up. This time you should try to make all sections make sense and transitions work. It is ok if there are still some typos, but try to reduce them.
