# Design Analysis: Accessibility

We want to provide you, the reader, a chance to explore accessibility more.

In this activity you will be looking at a social media site on your device (e.g., your phone or computer).

We will again follow the five step [CIDER method](https://medium.com/@OAlannah/beyond-average-users-building-inclusive-design-skills-with-the-cider-technique-413969544e6d?source=friends_link&sk=6c9184c8a88feae058cfb073a44985f7) {cite:p}`olesonAverageUsersBuilding2022b` (Critique, Imagine, Design, Expand, Repeat).

![Diagram of the CIDER method. 5 steps in order from left to right: Critique (Identify embedded assumptions about users); Imagine (Pick one assumption and envision how it excludes users); Design (Brainstorm changes to improve inclusion); Expand (Learn about new types of bias from peers' assumptions); Repeat (Redo I and D using new-to-you assumptions from EXPAND list).](cider-method.jpeg)

So open a social media site on your device (the website or app may have additional accessibility settings, but don't use those for now, just consider how it works as it is currently). Then do the following (preferably on paper or in a blank computer document):

## Critique (3-5 minutes, by yourself):
What assumptions do the site and your device make about individuals or groups using social media, which might not be true or might cause problems? List as many as you can think of (bullet points encouraged).

## Imagine (2-3 minutes, by yourself):
Select one of the above assumptions that you think is important to address. Then write a 1-2 sentence scenario where a user face difficulties because of the assumption you selected. This represents one way the design could exclude certain users.

## Design (3-5 minutes, by yourself):
Brainstorm ways to change the site or your device to avoid the scenario you wrote above. List as many different kinds of potential solutions you can think of – aim for ten or more (bullet points encouraged).

## Expand (5-10 minutes, with others):
Combine your list of critiques with someone else's (or if possible, have a whole class combine theirs).

## Repeat the Imagine and Design Tasks:
Select another assumption from the list above that you think is important to address. Make sure to choose a different assumption than you used before. Choose one that you didn’t come up with yourself, if possible. Repeat the Imagine and Design steps.


## Explore accessibility settings

Now, try to find the accessibility settings on the social media site and on your device.

For each setting you see, try to come up with what disabilities that setting would be beneficial for (there may be multiple).
