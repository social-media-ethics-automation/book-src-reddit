# Demo: Alt-text From Reddit

Reddit unfortunately doesn't allow alt-text for their images. So while we were going to have a programming demo here to look up the alt-text, there is no alt-text on images uploaded to Reddit to look up, meaning this site is unfriendly to blind or low-vision users.

See one of the other platforms for a demo.
