# Reflection: Ethics of Choosing Data Representation

We've now looked at how different ways of storing data and putting constraints on data can make social media systems work better for some people than others, and we've looked at how this data also informs decision-making and who is taken into account in ethics analyses.

Given all that can be at stake in making decisions on how data will be stored and constrained, choose one type of data a social media site might collect (e.g., name, age, location, gender, posts you liked, etc.), and then choose two different ethics frameworks and consider what each framework would mean for someone choosing how that data will be stored and constrained.
