## [Design Justice](https://design-justice.pubpub.org/) {cite:p}`DesignJustice`
- “Design justice is a framework for analysis of how design distributes benefits and burdens between various groups of people. Design justice focuses explicitly on the ways that design reproduces and/or challenges the matrix of domination (white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, settler colonialism, and other forms of structural inequality).”
- It’s also about which groups get to be part of the design process itself.
